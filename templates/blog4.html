                <h1>ROLE OF RAG PICKERS IN OUR COMMUNITY</h1>
                <img src="/static/images/b3.avif" alt="Plastic" style="width: 500px;">
                <p>Ragpickers play a crucial, yet often overlooked, role in society by contributing significantly to waste management and environmental sustainability.
                    These individuals, who collect and sort through discarded materials, help in reducing the volume of waste that ends up in landfills.
                    By salvaging recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, and metal, ragpickers facilitate the recycling process, thus conserving natural resources and reducing pollution.
                    Moreover, ragpickers support the economy by providing raw materials to recycling industries at a lower cost.
                    Their work also indirectly supports municipal waste management systems by easing the burden on official waste collection services.
                    Despite their significant contributions, ragpickers often work in hazardous conditions and face social stigma.
                    Recognizing their efforts and providing them with better working conditions, safety gear, and access to social benefits can enhance their quality of life and further improve waste managementÂ systems.</p>
